# lcplants v1.0.1
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ropensci/lcplants.svg?branch=master)]()

The R-package is able to apply a text-based search of plant names on the LCP using a fuzzy match 
algorithm, which is the core of the searching engine. The fuzzy match algorithm is applied at genus, 
epithet, infraspecies and authority level of a plant species and it uses the 'max.distance' argument 
from the agrep() R-function to assess the comparison between the searched plant name and the closest, 
in terms of number of similar characters plant name from the LCP.
Through the "lcplants" R-package, the user can search either for a single plant name or for a list of names. 
There are no limitation on the list length, but we strongly recommend the list to less than 5000 names 
to ensure a reasonable speed of the execution. The input list of plant names has to be organized as a list 
of names each on a separated line and saved in a text (.txt) or comma-separated values (.csv) file. 
Following the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants 
(Shenzhen Code: https://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php), which sets the rules to describe plant taxa names, 
the user has to write the taxon specifying the different terms separated by spaces as the following: genus, 
epithet, infraspecies rank, infraspecies name and authorship (e.g. Draba mollissima var. kusnezowii N.Busch). 
The user must use no special characters at the level of genus, epithet and infraspecies 
ranks; but special character can be possible only at the authorship level. The infraspecies name has to be 
preceded by the infraspecies rank (e.g. "subsp.", "var.", "forma", "ssp.", "f.", "subvar.", "subf."). 
At least the taxon name has to be written with the two-term naming system, which defines a species 
(binomial nomenclature system); the infraspecies and authorship are optional for a finer search. 
The only possible cases, where the function accepts one single name, are when the user wants to perform 
the search only for the genus, order or family ranks; but in these cases the options 'genus_tab', 
'family_tab' or 'order_tab' have to be activated (e.g. genus_tab = TRUE; FALSE is default). Lastly, 
if the genus or the epithet names are composed by two words, they have to be separated by a hyphen ("-") 
character and never by space (e.g. Hibiscus rosa-sinensis L.; never as Hibiscus rosa sinensis L.). 
The proper way to submit an hybrid plant taxon is using the characters '_x' in the end of the genus and 
epithet name (e.g. Spartocytisus_x filipes Webb & Berthel., Lycopodium habereri_x House). 
However the lcplants R-package is able to accept other forms of submitted plant names such as 'x' or 'x_' 
before the names both upper or lower case (e.g. x Spartocytisus filipes Webb & Berthel., 
x_Spartocytisus filipes Webb & Berthel., Lycopodium x habereri House) and change them automatically 
into the required format. The commonly used special Unicode Character "U+00D7" for indicating 
hybrids is not accepted.
If the user wants to submit a list of plant names to be searched, the user has to write the following 
sentence on the R/RStudio console: LCP('list', ...); the term 'list' will inform the function that has been 
submitted a list of plant names stored in a file. Then an external window will appear to search for 
the path where the file is stored. If the user wants to submit a single taxon the user has to submit 
the sentence as the following example: "LCP('Payena lancifolia H.J.Lam', ...)", followed by one or more options.
